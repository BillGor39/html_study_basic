        <h1 style="background-color: aliceblue; text-align: center;">Mercury</h1>
        <img class="planet" src="/images_6/Mercury_in_true_color.jpg" alt="mercury" />
        <p class="planct-paragraph"><b>Mercury</b> is the first planet from the Sun and the 
            smallest in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial 
            planet with a heavily cratered surface due to 
            overlapping impact events. These features are well 
            preserved since the planet has no geological activity and 
            an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. 
            Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System 
            with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that 
            of Earth, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same 
            surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic 
            field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has 
            no natural satellites.</p>

        <h1 style="background-color: aliceblue; text-align: center;">Venus</h1>
        <img class="planet" src="/images_6/RifjtkFLBEFgzkZqWEh69P.jpg" alt="venus" />
        <p class="planct-paragraph"><b>Venus</b> is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky 
            planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky 
            bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a 
            mass and size that is close to that of its orbital 
            neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's 
            orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, 
            as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". While this 
            is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more 
            prominently, since it is the third brightest object 
            in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,[20][21] 
            appearing brighter than any other star-like classical 
            planet or any fixed star. With such prominence in Earth's 
            sky, Venus has historically been a common and important 
            object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.</p>

        <h1 style="background-color: aliceblue; text-align: center;">Earth</h1>
        <img class="planet" src="/images_6/The_Blue_Marble_(remastered).jpg" alt="earth" />
        <p class="planct-paragraph"><b>Earth</b> is the third planet from the Sun and the only 
            astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled 
            by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar 
            System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's 
            water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of 
            Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, 
            most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses 
            within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of 
            Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, 
            while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain 
            more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and 
            atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of 
            slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce 
            mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a 
            liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of 
            deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic 
            radiation.</p>
